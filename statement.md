# ORAL HEALTH ORGANISER

## Problem statement
Most people cannot detect early signs of oral health issues such as cavities, plaque, gum disease, or ulcers. Not everyone can afford professional checkups every so often. There is a need afor an easy tool that will analyze oral images, provide quick feedback, and store previous health records for easy monitoring.


## Scope of the project 


The project will emulate oral health analysis using modular Python code.
It allows users to input details, upload an image, receive predicted results, and get recommendations.
It also stores and retrieves user history for future reference.t
The scope is limited to the simulation, not actual ML, but it is designed in such a way that real models can be added later.

## Target users 
People who need information quickly about their current status of oral health.
Students learning modular programming and project structuring.
Beginners who want to understand Python-based system design.
Anyone desiring a straightforward method for monitoring oral health

## High level features

User profile creation: name, age, history
Image input & simulated preprocessing
Simulated oral issue prediction
Recommendations for the detected issues
Generating and displaying reports
Save and load user records using JSON
Easy, menu-driven interface
